while continued fraction factorization is not the fastest factorization algorithm we know today it is still in the same 
time complexity category as number field sieve and ecm. This method has a theoretical runtime of
O(ep2logNloglogN), and was the fastest prime factorization algorithm in use until the development of the quadratic sieve
method.
Though the quadratic residues produced by the continued fraction method are quite small,
trial dividing them takes a long time. It might be that lot's of Qn do not decompose over
the chosen factor basis and lot's of work is done without getting a relation. Therefore the
continued fraction method is limited to factoring numbers with up to 50 digits.
This problem of the continued fraction algorithm was overcome with another algorithm,
the so called quadratic sieve algorithm. The main advantage of the quadratic sieve
algorithm over CFRAC is the improvement that it uses a sieve to find candidates zn which
indeed decompose over the factor basis. Since sieving is much cheaper than trial dividing
lot of numbers, this trick let to a big practical improvement, as we will see in Section 5.6.
Additionally, the size of the elements zn is approximately the same as the size of the zn
generated in the CFRAC algorithm.
