While CFRAC is not the fastest factorization algorithm we know today it is still in the same 
time complexity category as number field sieve and ecm. This method has a theoretical runtime of
O(ep2logNloglogN).Though the quadratic residues produced by the continued fraction method are quite small,
trial dividing them takes a long time. This problem of the continued fraction algorithm was overcome with another algorithm,
the so called quadratic sieve algorithm. it uses a sieve to find candidates zn which
indeed decompose over the factor basis. Since sieving is much cheaper than trial dividing
lot of numbers, this trick let to a big practical improvement.
