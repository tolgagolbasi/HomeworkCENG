Dear Coordinator,
I am very interested in pursuing a masters degree in Computer Science. My review of graduate programs in Finland, and discussion with my professors and colleagues, it is clear to me that the University of Tampere has an excellent Software Development Programme.

I am completed a wide-ranged Undergraduate Program in Mathematics Majoring in Computer Science at the Ege University. I had quite a few programming classes in undergraduate like C and C# while i took JAVA training after i finished my education. I have not got any software development classes because we re not allowed to take them. I know that can put me behind other applicants but i am very much interested to close that gap with the education i am getting in University of Tampere. My objectives at University of Tampere are settling in Finland first and want to develop a interesting video game with my colleagues. After my education i will be looking for a job in Finland if its possible and i want to continue my education further if my job allows me to do so. I hope that the skills and knowledge I obtain from this graduate degree will give me the opportunity to seek a very good job in field of software development and at the same time giving me tools and perception for research in this field.

My parents and sister will be funding for my education my parents are retired and have a solid income while my sister is a math teacher with good income. I am interested in taking a part time job, if my education allows me, when i settled in.

I have enclosed all materials required for acceptance into the masters program. Thank you very much for your consideration of my application.

Very truly yours,


Tolga Gölbaþý
