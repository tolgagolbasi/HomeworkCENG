Finite Field Extensions is widely used in multivariate cryptography applications. 
The fact that solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations are proven to be 
NP-Hard or NP-Complete makes them perfect candidates for Post-Quantum Cryptography. 
In this presentation we will look at the logic behind contruction of Finite Field Extensions.
